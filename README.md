// Author: Kaitlyn Leon | Last Updated: 5-22-2022 | CS3100 Final Project  //

This is my final project for CS3100: Data Structures and Algorithms. The goal of this project
was to create a collection of key:value pairs and perform the functions outlined below. I 
used local storage to store key:value pairs

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this Book Collection Program will store the user's books to
local storage. The user will be able to perform the following functions: 

-[Add] Book to Collection
-[Delete] Book from Collection
-[Search] Series in Collection
-[Print] All Books and Authors in Collection
-[Sort] Existing Books in Collection
